# Middle-Earth Genealogy Project

The aim of this project is to create a free genealogy data
from all the family trees mentioned in Tolkien's legendarium.

Unlike similar projects which often focus on the visual aspect and don't provide
the underlying data, this project was started mainly for the sake of the data itself.

The project uses the [GEDCOM](http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~pmcbride/gedcom/55gctoc.htm) specification.

## Use

The project is structured into four parts

* `atani.ged` - The Three Houses of Edain
* `nunatani.ged` - Men of Númenor and Gondor, Stewards of Gondor, Princes of Dol Amroth, Men of Éothéd and Rohan
* `eldar.ged` - Elves
* `casari.ged` - Dwarves
* `periandi.ged` - Hobbits
